# tonus API

The behavioral source of truth for the public API: thirteen methods on
the `tonus` namespace, no sub-namespaces.

```js
import tonus from "tonus";
```

## Theory & stance

tonus is a music-analysis and data library. It treats the chant repertoire as
musical and historical material (modes, tuning, neumes, prosody, the analytic
imprint) not as liturgy to be performed. The liturgical scaffolding is here
because that is how this music was transmitted and indexed for a thousand years:
the calendar is a retrieval key, the feast a filter, the office an ordering. They
are the catalogue, not the point.

The music came to us through the Church because that is who kept the books, but
this is a library for the music. Half the cantors who wrote it down likely held
a working musician's skepticism toward the institution around them; many still
do. tonus takes no theological position and asks none of its users. What it
models is the sound and its structure.

## Conventions

### Latin and English

The language of a key tells you the register of its value. A Latin key
returns authentic Latin content; an English key returns a machine code or
datum. Where a concept has both registers, they form a pair:

| English            | Latin    |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| `season`           | `tempus` |
| `grade`            | `ritus`  |
| `mode`             | `modus`  |
| `name` (on `Body`) | `nomen`  |

Other fields carry only one register. Latin-only, _e.g._ `genus`, `ordinarium`,
`incipit`, `differentia`, `accentus`. English-only, _e.g._ `date`, `velocity`, `hz`.

Display strings live in exported maps (_e.g._ `SEASON_LABELS`),
never as label fields on objects.

### Query and builder functions

**Query functions** name what you want and return arrays. Empty matches
return `[]`, never `null`. Calendar results sort `day asc, dignity desc`;
chant results sort by rank then incipit.

**Builder functions** construct and return context objects, and throw
`Error` on invalid input.

Context objects can be passed back into query functions as filters:

```js
const feasts = tonus.festum({ season: "pasc" });
tonus.proprium({ feast: feasts, office: "an" });

const t = tonus.temperamentum({ tuning: "pythagorean" });
t.nota("D4");
```

### Dates

Dates are UTC-canonical. Local-time constructions like
`new Date(2026, 0, 6)` resolve to different days depending on the
machine's timezone. Prefer `new Date("2026-01-06")` instead.

`tonus.festum()` and `tonus.caelum()` default to an emblematic
medieval epoch, **1 June 991**, the symbolic birthday of Guido d'Arezzo. Pass
an explicit `date` for any other day.

### Determinism

All pure transforms are deterministic for identical inputs and options.
No runtime network requests are made.

## Error contract

- Query functions return `[]` on no match, never throw.
- Builder functions throw `Error` with a descriptive message on invalid input.
- `notatio` throws on invalid `Chant` input.
- `temperamentum.tonus()` throws if `mode` is `"auto"` — mode must be set
  explicitly.
- Malformed `comma`, ratio, or Scala input throws `RangeError`; custom scales
  must supply 7 or 12 steps.
- `pascha` throws `RangeError` on a non-finite year.
