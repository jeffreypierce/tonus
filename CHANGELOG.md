# Changelog

All notable changes to tonus. Newest first.

## 0.3.0

The vox-ectomy. The voice engine (`vox`, `chorus`, the formant tables,
personae, consortia, liquescentia coda tables, spectrum, accordatio) leaves
the public library for orreliquum, the private instrument it was always
being built toward. tonus returns to what it is: theory, calendar, chant,
notation, and the heavens — the algorithms, publishable and citable.

### Added

- **`accent` on `ChantTabulaRow`** — a boolean marking whether a note's
  syllable bears the Latin tonic word-accent. The value already existed inside
  the parse (`detectVowelAccent` drives articulation stress); it is now surfaced
  as data on the tabula, so downstream analysis can read accent placement
  without re-deriving it. Threaded `ParsedNote → Context → ChantTabulaRow`.

### Removed

- **`tonus.vox()` and `tonus.chorus()`** and every voice type
  (`Vox`, `VoxInput`, `VoxParams`, `Vowel`, `Formant`, `Locus`, `Latinitas`,
  `Persona`, `PersonaName`, `Coda`, `TuningLike`, `Chorus`, `ChorusOpts`,
  `Dispersio`, `ConsortiumName`, `Voces`). The namespace holds fourteen
  verbs again. `docs/voice.md` emigrates with the code.
- Voice test suites (`voice-vox`, `voice-chorus`, `voice-features`,
  `voice-spectrum`) move with their subject.

### Unchanged

- `harmonia`'s planetary voices (`VoicedPitch`, `VoicedBody`, the Greek
  vowel tables) are its own and remain.
- Every other engine, table, and contract.

## 0.2.0

Rendering becomes a standalone engine (`inscriptio`), the per-chant analysis
chart is completed, a voice engine is added, and the emitter surface settles on
one format (SVG).

### Added

- **`inscriptio(score, opts?)`** — the standalone SVG renderer. Draws a `Score`
  and returns `{ svg, geometry }`. Two notation species, each with its own
  spacing pass: `"quadrata"` (square-note, SMuFL glyphs baked inline) and
  `"moderna"` (modern round-note transcription — treble-8 clef, engraved slurs,
  after the Lomer practice). A multi-system **layout engine** (`width`,
  `systemGap`, `custos`) and **front matter** (`title`, `rubric` /
  `annotation: "auto"`, `dropcap`, `rubricaColor`).
- **The geometry contract** — `geometry: NoteGeometry[]`, one entry per note in
  tabula order (system, x, y, systemY). A public API: downstream analysis tracks
  build on it instead of scraping the SVG.
- **The intonation channel** — `accidentals: "standard" | "heji" | "cents"`, a
  **moderna** overlay. HEJI comma accidentals are baselined on the Pythagorean
  chain (tonus's default tuning), so a Pythagorean chant renders clean and
  syntonic-comma arrows bloom only under a just preset; meantone is not just, so
  `heji` throws under it. `cents` labels signed deviations against `"pythagorean"`
  (default) or `"et"`. Square notation (`quadrata`) carries only the accidentals
  GABC itself expresses (flat / natural / sharp) — the HEJI and cents overlays are
  modern analytical marks, so quadrata throws when asked for them.
- **Score metrics** on `prosody`: interval statistics (histogram, maxLeap,
  leapRate, step/skip/leap `motus`), `tessitura`, the melodic `arcus`
  (initial/peak/final + arch index), `melismaCadential`; and conveniences
  `phrase.noteCount` / `phrase.syllableCount` / `syllable.melisma`.
- **`vox` and `chorus`** — a singing voice modelled as formant and spectrum
  data, and seeded ensembles. `formantes` tunes to a temperament directly:
  `tenor.formantes("a", temper, vis?)` — `vis` weights the pull, 0 (phonetic
  truth) to 1 (fully tuned, the default).
- **The appendix.** The export law is settled: verbs live on the namespace,
  return values are plain data, and the named exports are canonical constant
  tables only — `SEASON_LABEL`, `TEMPUS_NAME`, `GRADE_ORDER`, `GRADE_NAME`,
  `MODES`, `TONES` (types `PsalmTone`/`Differentia` ride with their table).
  The grade helper functions (`gradeOrder`, `compareGrade`, `ritusToGrade`)
  retire from the surface: `gradeOrder(g)` is `GRADE_ORDER.indexOf(g)`.
- **`docs/` ships in the package** — the documentation renders from the
  installed tarball, pinned to the version it describes.
- **GABC lyric markup decodes.** The angle-bracket text tags — excluded since
  the MIDI-only days — are parsed at intake: `<sp>` specials become real
  characters (℣ ℟ † ǽ œ, the raised *), style tags (`<i>`, `<b>`, `<sc>`,
  `<c>` rubric color, `<e>` elision) survive as styled `runs` on `Syllable`
  and the tabula row, and both notation species draw them as `<tspan>`s.
  Layout hints (`<clear>`, `<nlba>`, centering braces) and `\pageref`
  cross-references vanish. Before this, quadrata printed `<sp>V/</sp>` as
  literal lyric text and syllable widths were measured tags-and-all.
- **Per-role text faces** — `inscriptio`'s `fonts` option assigns a face to
  the `dropcap`, `title`, `annotation`, and `lyric` roles (family, optional
  weight, optional size scale). By default the SVG carries references and
  the host page supplies the face; a slot may instead `embed` the caller's
  own font bytes (base64) into the SVG's `<style>` for a self-contained
  file. tonus bundles no font files either way.

### Changed

- **License: PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0** (was MIT through 0.1.x, which
  remain MIT). Free for any noncommercial purpose; commercial use by
  arrangement with the author.
- **Corpus double-escape fixed.** Every `gabc` field stored its non-ASCII as a
  literal `\uXXXX` escape, which had silently disabled accent detection across
  the whole corpus — so note weights, prosody, rhythm, and imprint were computed
  accent-blind. The extractor now decodes correctly; **computed accent weights
  shift corpus-wide** as a result. A guard test asserts no gabc carries an escape.
- **`cantus({})` throws.** An empty or unknown-key chant query is a caller bug,
  not an empty result; it throws with guidance (matching the `festum` contract).
- NABC pipes stripped from the corpus (`(notes|nabc)` → `(notes)`), with a
  corpus-wide guard test.

### Fixed (pre-release review)

- **The Pythagorean chain is the medieval dodecachord (E♭–G♯).** The chain had
  stacked twelve fifths ascending from C, spelling F as E♯ — a 521.5¢ wolf
  ut–fa — and b molle as A♯, so `temperamentum` disagreed with `harmonia`'s own
  pure F. The naturals now sit F–B with b molle and E♭ on the flat side, the
  ficta sharps on the sharp side; the heji/cents baseline derives from the same
  chain constant, so a flatted chant under the default tuning renders clean
  (it had thrown).
- **Quadrata figure grouping is phrase-aware.** A single-syllable phrase
  followed by another phrase merged figures across the divisio, silently
  dropping the second lyric and the divisio itself. An accidental inflecting
  any note of a ligature now prints before the whole figure (Solesmes
  practice) instead of vanishing on non-initial notes.
- **Canticles by name resolve their own texts.** `magnificat` and
  `nunc dimittis` pointed at the wrong psalter rows (one returned the Symbolum
  Athanasium); `te deum` is withdrawn — the Te Deum is not psalmody.
- **Formula step-skeletons count Apel's degrees.** Octave-aware relative to the
  final's register: the mode-5 tenor reads +4, where the old ±half-octave fold
  read −3. (Cadence figures keep their deliberate local-contour fold.)
- **The register doctrine at the seams.** `Matins.nomen` / `Matins.ritus`
  (were `name` / `rank`), `PsalmTone.nomen`, and `rubricaColor` (was `rubrica`,
  a Latin key that took a CSS color string).
- **The error contract enforced across the surface.** `notatio`, `festum`,
  `caelum`, `matutinum`, `harmonia`, `proprium`, `temperamentum`, and `vox`
  throw with guidance on junk input instead of raw TypeErrors or silent
  fallbacks; a bare `chorus()` sings (the schola is the default); `psalmus`
  no longer stamps the wall-clock year into `source.year` (determinism);
  `iter` honours the `latinitas` shift; a user-GABC `office-part` header
  normalizes to its OfficeCode.

### Removed

- **The MusicXML and MIDI emitters** (`score.musicxml()`, `score.midi()`).
  tonus emits one format now: SVG. Microtuning still lives on the tabula
  (`bend`/`hz`/`offset`) for a Web-Audio player to read directly — microtonally
  exact, which MIDI never was.

## 0.1.8

- **Roman Matins.** `matutinum({ feast })` assembles the structured Roman night
  office — the nocturns with their great responsories — from the community
  *Nocturnale Romanum* (new `nr` chant source, 1,564 chants). Sanctorale feasts
  draw Matins from their commune; coverage is the sanctorale and Advent today
  (see COVERAGE.md). A separate accessor; the flat `officium` path is unchanged.

## 0.1.7

- **`corpus(code)`** — metadata and analytics for a corpus book. Returns its
  bibliographic identity (title, full Latin title, edition, year, editor, scan
  attribution — drawn from GregoBase's catalogue) plus a breakdown of its
  contents: genre distribution, mode distribution (I–VIII with a null bucket),
  and cross-book **overlap** — the book's full pre-dedup `total`, its `unique`
  count, and how many chants it `shared` with each other book. The overlap shows,
  e.g., that the Liber Usualis is largely the Graduale and Antiphonarius combined,
  while the Antiphonale Monasticum is nearly its own repertoire.
- The `*_SOURCE` objects now carry `fullTitle`, `edition`, and `scanSource`.

## 0.1.6

- **The monastic Office.** `officium({ rite: "monasticum" })` assembles the
  Benedictine cursus — the little hours, Lauds, Vespers, Compline, and Prime —
  from the Antiphonale Monasticum, with the monastic psalm distribution
  (Compline is Ps 4, 90, 133). The Roman rite is the default; the two share a
  calendar. Monastic Matins is served flat (its nocturn structure is future
  work). Also adds the Antiphonale Monasticum (1934) as a retrievable chant
  source: `cantus({ source: "am" })`, 1,429 chants.
- **Guidonian hand** corrected to the canonical counter-clockwise spiral (it had
  filled linearly). The `Finger`/`Region` types are tightened (`wrist`/`palm`
  removed, `super` added).
- **Double mora** (`..`) now lengthens correctly, and `Note.context` /
  the tabula row carry `mora: 0 | 1 | 2` (was a `doubleEpisema` boolean) so the
  single/double distinction is available for scoring.
- **f-clef** pitch mapping fixed (f3/f4 were a third off).
- Internal: generated corpus data separated from hand-authored tables;
  `office-psalms` → `office-psalms-roman`.

## 0.1.5

- **Rhythmic types** (`phrase.rhythmicType`, `phrase.beats`) — Le Guennant/Carroll
  incise classification IV–VIII over the compound-beat sequence, with Type VIII
  (contraction) after Suñol. The `beats` sequence is the shared derivation the
  chironomy renderer will read.

## 0.1.4

- **Modulation detection** (`score.modulations`) — where the tonal centre leans
  away from the home mode, calibrated against Suñol.
- **Modal affinity** — degree-, ictus-, and cadence-weighted, with ranked
  initials after Rockstro.
- **`modus()`** tunes its finalis, tenor, and ambitus through the temperamentum.

## 0.1.3

- **Cadence detection** (`score.cadences`) — per-mode melodic cadence figures,
  after Niedermeyer & d'Ortigue.
- Psalm tones _in directum_ and solemn mediants.
- Suñol-derived neum timing (salicus, oriscus).
- The Latin modal ethos.

## 0.1.2

- **Little-hours psalmody** (Terce, Sext, None) — Ps 118 in course, from the
  extracted Divinum Officium Tridentine scheme. The Divine Office is now complete
  across all eight hours.

## 0.1.1

- **Prime and Compline** office hours — the seasonal ordos, assembled from
  existing corpus chants.

## 0.1.0

- Core release: tuning (`temperamentum`), calendar (`festum`/`pascha`), chant
  (`cantus`/`proprium`/`ordinarium`/`officium`/`psalmus`), score
  (`notatio` → MIDI/MusicXML), heavens (`caelum`/`harmonia`).
